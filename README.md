# This is a Simple Prime Calculator fully written in C
It has
- a function that checks if a given number is a prime
- a example of how to use that to find a specified amount of Primes
- a verification loop at the end of the main() to test if what it calculatoed is actually correct

# Why do you have a "BACKUP_main.c" ?
This does not contain the Verifyer Part, and should be a lot easyer to open, due to it not having a ton of Primes in a Array!

# Thats it!
This can be compiled with GCC 13
